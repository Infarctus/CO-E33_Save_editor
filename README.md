# Tauri + Vanilla TS

This template should help get you started developing with Tauri in vanilla HTML, CSS and Typescript.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)


## TODO
- Rename app
- Implement tabs for different functionalities
- A lock system (avois having pultiple instances of the app running at the same time ? OR put backups in time-related dirs. Than way there's almost no chance of collision)
