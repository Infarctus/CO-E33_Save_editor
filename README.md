You simply need to launch co-e33-save-editor and then everything is done within the app.

Installation :
1. Get the file you want for your OS
2. Unzip it

Additional info
- When opening a file, our tool is able to correclty parse any Uneral Engine Save file (commonly referred to as GVAS).
- If you tried opening something else, none of the tabs will be available. If it opens correctly, you can view its contents inside the Raw Json tab.
- If any of the regular tab show something along the lines of "The file you opened (if any) doesn't look like a CO:E33 save file", this means that the structure of the properties inside the sav is not the one a regular CO:E33 save file is expected to have
- When you save a filed edited with the editor, the date/time associated with it in-game will match your current date/time
- In most tabs where there are tables, you can sort by clicking on a table header, i.e. on the Pictos tab you can click on level to order by level (asc), click again on the table header to sort by desc. You can also sort booleans (found, mastered, etc)
